# springboot-mongodb-app

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive learning and development example of a Java Spring Boot application integrated with MongoDB. It demonstrates how to build, containerize, and deploy the application using various containerization and orchestration tools.

Whether you're a beginner or looking to enhance your DevOps skills, this repository offers practical, hands-on examples using:

- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**
- **Kubernetes**
- **Kustomize**
- **Helm Charts**

### What You'll Learn

By working through this repository, you'll gain:

1. **Spring Boot + MongoDB Integration**
   - Build a RESTful application using Java Spring Boot
   - Connect and interact with MongoDB as a database backend

2. **Containerization with Docker**
   - Create Docker images for the application
   - Run the application inside containers

3. **Multi-Container Deployment with Docker Compose**
   - Define multi-service architecture (App + MongoDB) using Docker Compose
   - Manage application lifecycle with `docker-compose` CLI

4. **Container Orchestration with Kubernetes**
   - Deploy the application on Kubernetes clusters
   - Use manifests to manage services, deployments, and volumes

5. **Declarative Deployment with Kustomize**
   - Understand how to use Kustomize for Kubernetes resource customization
   - Simplify environment-specific configuration management

6. **Declarative Deployment with Helm Chart**
   - Learn how to package, template, and install applications using Helm
   - Manage reusable deployments across environments with values files
   - Simplify upgrades and rollbacks for your Spring Boot + MongoDB stack

7. **Database Integration in Kubernetes**
